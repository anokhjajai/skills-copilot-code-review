## Frontend Guidelines

- Use accessibility attributes (e.g., `alt` text for images, `aria-label` / `aria-labelledby` when additional labeling is needed, and appropriate `role` attributes) and ensure sufficient color contrast (meeting WCAG AA where possible) without relying on color alone to convey information.
- Use responsive design for compatibility with mobile devices.
- Validate HTML structure and semantic elements.
